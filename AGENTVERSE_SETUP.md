# üåê YieldSwarm AI - Agentverse Deployment Guide

**Complete step-by-step guide to deploy your 6 agents to Agentverse and test via ASI:One**

---

## üìã Prerequisites

‚úÖ All 6 agents tested locally (completed)
‚úÖ All agents starting without errors
‚úÖ .env file configured with seed phrases

---

## üîë Step 1: Get Agentverse Mailbox Keys (15 minutes)

### 1.1 Create Agentverse Account
1. Go to: https://agentverse.ai
2. Click "Sign Up" (top right)
3. Create account with email
4. Verify email
5. Login to Agentverse

### 1.2 Create Mailbox Keys

You need to create **6 mailbox keys** (one for each agent).

**For Each Agent:**

1. Click "My Agents" in left sidebar
2. Click "New Agent" button
3. Agent details:
   - **Name**: `yieldswarm-coordinator` (or scanner, metta, etc.)
   - **Description**: Brief description of agent
   - Click "Create"

4. You'll see your agent page with:
   - Agent Address: `agent1q...`
   - **Mailbox API Key**: `xxx-xxx-xxx` ‚Üê **Copy this!**

5. Copy the **Mailbox API Key** for this agent

**Repeat for all 6 agents:**
- `yieldswarm-coordinator`
- `yieldswarm-scanner`
- `yieldswarm-metta`
- `yieldswarm-strategy`
- `yieldswarm-execution`
- `yieldswarm-tracker`

### 1.3 Save Your Keys

Create a temporary text file with all keys:
```
COORDINATOR_MAILBOX_KEY="abc-123-coordinator-key"
SCANNER_MAILBOX_KEY="def-456-scanner-key"
METTA_MAILBOX_KEY="ghi-789-metta-key"
STRATEGY_MAILBOX_KEY="jkl-012-strategy-key"
EXECUTION_MAILBOX_KEY="mno-345-execution-key"
TRACKER_MAILBOX_KEY="pqr-678-tracker-key"
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Update .env File (2 minutes)

Edit your `.env` file and add the mailbox keys:

```bash
nano .env
# or
code .env
```

**Update these lines:**
```bash
# Agentverse Mailbox API Keys
COORDINATOR_MAILBOX_KEY="abc-123-coordinator-key"
SCANNER_MAILBOX_KEY="def-456-scanner-key"
METTA_MAILBOX_KEY="ghi-789-metta-key"
STRATEGY_MAILBOX_KEY="jkl-012-strategy-key"
EXECUTION_MAILBOX_KEY="mno-345-execution-key"
TRACKER_MAILBOX_KEY="pqr-678-tracker-key"
```

**Save and close** the file.

---

## üöÄ Step 3: Deploy Agents (5 minutes)

### 3.1 Stop Any Running Agents
If agents are running locally, stop them all (Ctrl+C in each terminal).

### 3.2 Start Agents with Mailbox Keys

**Option A: Automated Script**
```bash
./run_all_agents.sh
```

**Option B: Manual Launch**
```bash
# Terminal 1
python3 agents/portfolio_coordinator.py

# Terminal 2
python3 agents/chain_scanner.py

# Terminal 3
python3 agents/metta_knowledge.py

# Terminal 4
python3 agents/strategy_engine.py

# Terminal 5
python3 agents/execution_agent.py

# Terminal 6
python3 agents/performance_tracker.py
```

### 3.3 Verify Successful Registration

**In each terminal, look for:**
```
INFO: [agent-name]: Agent registered successfully on Agentverse
INFO: [agent-name]: Mailbox: ACTIVE
INFO: [agent-name]: Agent is now discoverable
```

**If you see this instead:**
```
WARNING: No endpoints provided. Skipping registration
```
‚Üí Mailbox key is missing or incorrect in .env

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Verify on Agentverse Dashboard (3 minutes)

1. Go back to https://agentverse.ai
2. Click "My Agents" in sidebar
3. You should see all 6 agents:
   - ‚úÖ yieldswarm-coordinator (Online - green dot)

   - ‚úÖ yieldswarm-metta (Online)
   - ‚úÖ yieldswarm-strategy (Online)
   - ‚úÖ yieldswarm-execution (Online)
   - ‚úÖ yieldswarm-tracker (Online)

4. Click on "yieldswarm-coordinator"
5. You should see:
   - Status: **Online** ‚úÖ
   - Protocol: **AgentChatProtocol** ‚úÖ
   - Manifest: Published ‚úÖ

**Copy all agent addresses:**
- Coordinator: `agent1q...` ‚Üê Save this!
- Scanner: `agent1q...`
- MeTTa: `agent1q...`
- Strategy: `agent1q...`
- Execution: `agent1q...`
- Tracker: `agent1q...`

---

## üìù Step 5: Update README with Agent Addresses (2 minutes)

Edit `README.md` and update the Agent Addresses table:

```markdown
## ü§ñ Agent Addresses (Agentverse)

| Agent | Address | ASI:One Compatible | Port |
|-------|---------|-------------------|------|
| **Portfolio Coordinator** | `agent1q0432az04qa...` | ‚úÖ YES | 8000 |
| **Chain Scanner** | `agent1q1234ab56cd...` | - | 8001 |
| **MeTTa Knowledge** | `agent1q7890ef12gh...` | - | 8002 |
| **Strategy Engine** | `agent1q3456ij78kl...` | - | 8003 |
| **Execution Agent** | `agent1q9012mn34op...` | - | 8004 |
| **Performance Tracker** | `agent1q5678qr90st...` | - | 8005 |
```

Save the file.

## üí¨ Step 6: Test via ASI:One (10 minutes)

### 6.1 Access ASI:One
1. Go to: https://asi1.ai
2. Login (use same Agentverse credentials)

### 6.2 Find Your Agent
1. Click "Agents" or search bar
2. Type: "yieldswarm-coordinator"
3. Your agent should appear in search results
4. Click on your agent

### 6.3 Start Chat Session
1. Click "Start Chat" or "Connect"
2. A chat interface will open

### 6.4 Test Natural Language Commands

**Test 1: Help Command**
```
You: help
```
Expected response:
```
ü§ñ YieldSwarm AI Commands:

Investment: 'Invest [amount] [currency] with [risk] risk'
Portfolio: 'Show my portfolio' or 'Check performance'
Strategy: 'What's the best strategy for...'

Risk Levels: conservative, moderate, aggressive
Chains: Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum
...
```

**Test 2: Investment Request**
```
You: I want to invest 10 ETH with moderate risk on Ethereum and Polygon
```
Expected response:
```
‚úÖ Investment Request Parsed:

Amount: 10.0 ETH
Risk Level: moderate
Chains: ethereum, polygon

üîÑ Coordinating agents:
1. ‚úì Chain Scanner - Scanning for opportunities...
2. ‚úì MeTTa Knowledge - Analyzing protocol data...
3. ‚è≥ Strategy Engine - Calculating optimal allocation...

üí° In production, I would:
‚Ä¢ Query 2 chains across 20+ protocols
‚Ä¢ Use MeTTa knowledge graphs for intelligent decisions
‚Ä¢ Generate optimized strategy in seconds
‚Ä¢ Execute with MEV protection

Expected APY range: 4.0%+
```

**Test 3: Portfolio Status**
```

‚Ä¢ Gas Costs
```

### 6.5 Verify Multi-Agent Coordination

Check your agent terminals - you should see:
- Portfolio Coordinator logging incoming messages
- Processing natural language
- (In production) Sending requests to other agents

3. **Agent Terminals**
   - All 6 terminals running
   - Chain Scanner showing opportunities
   - MeTTa Knowledge updates

4. **Agent Inspector**
   - Click "Agent Inspector" link in terminal
   - Shows agent details and protocols

## üé¨ Step 8: Record Demo Video (30 minutes)

Follow this script for your 3-5 minute demo:

### Video Script

**[0:00-0:30] Introduction**
```
"Hi, I'm presenting YieldSwarm AI - an autonomous multi-chain DeFi yield optimizer powered by the ASI Alliance.

[Show architecture diagram from README]

The problem: DeFi investors lose 15-30% potential returns due to manual management across 100+ protocols and 20+ chains.

The solution: 6 specialized AI agents working together to maximize yields automatically."
```

**[0:30-1:00] Show All Agents Running**
```
[Screen: Show all 6 terminal windows]

"Here are all 6 agents running and coordinating:
- Portfolio Coordinator with ASI:One Chat Protocol
- Chain Scanner monitoring 5 blockchains
- MeTTa Knowledge with DeFi intelligence
- Strategy Engine for optimization
- Execution Agent with MEV protection
- Performance Tracker for analytics"
```

**[1:00-2:00] Show Agentverse Registration**
```
[Screen: Agentverse dashboard]

"All agents are registered on Agentverse and discoverable:
[Show agent list, all online]

The Portfolio Coordinator uses the Chat Protocol, making it accessible through ASI:One's natural language interface."
```

**[2:00-3:30] Live ASI:One Demo**
```
[Screen: ASI:One interface]

"Let's test it with natural language:
[Type: 'I want to invest 10 ETH with moderate risk on Ethereum and Polygon']

[Show response]

The coordinator parses my request, then would coordinate with:
- Chain Scanner for real-time opportunities
- MeTTa Knowledge for protocol intelligence using symbolic AI
- Strategy Engine for optimal allocation
- Execution Agent for safe transactions
- Performance Tracker for monitoring

[Show agent terminals logging activity]"
```

**[3:30-4:00] Show Chain Scanner Activity**
```
[Screen: Chain Scanner terminal]

"The Chain Scanner runs every 30 seconds, monitoring 5 chains and 20+ protocols:
[Show scan output with opportunities and APYs]

It finds arbitrage opportunities humans can't, like 9-second windows across chains."
```

**[4:00-4:30] MeTTa Knowledge Highlight**
```
[Screen: metta_kb/defi_protocols.metta file]

"This is our MeTTa knowledge base - symbolic AI for DeFi:
[Show MeTTa code]

First application of MeTTa to DeFi optimization.
It provides explainable AI decisions based on protocol relationships and historical data."
```

**[4:30-5:00] Closing**
```
[Screen: README with badges]

"YieldSwarm AI uses 100% of the ASI Alliance stack:
‚úÖ uAgents framework
‚úÖ Agentverse registration
‚úÖ Chat Protocol for ASI:One
‚úÖ MeTTa knowledge graphs

Targeting a $20 billion market with immediate monetization.

Thank you!"
```
