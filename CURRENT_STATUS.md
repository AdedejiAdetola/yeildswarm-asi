## 🔄 IN PROGRESS (5% Remaining)

### 1. ⏳ Run Remaining 5 Agents Locally
**Status:** Portfolio Coordinator running, need to start 5 more

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Open 5 more terminals and run:
python3 agents/chain_scanner.py         # Terminal 2
python3 agents/metta_knowledge.py       # Terminal 3
python3 agents/strategy_engine.py       # Terminal 4
python3 agents/execution_agent.py       # Terminal 5
python3 agents/performance_tracker.py   # Terminal 6
```

**Expected:** Each agent starts successfully on ports 8001-8005
