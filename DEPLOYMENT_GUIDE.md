# YieldSwarm AI - Deployment Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide walks you through deploying YieldSwarm AI agents to Agentverse and testing via ASI:One.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ All 6 agents built and tested locally
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- ‚úÖ Agentverse account created at [agentverse.ai](https://agentverse.ai)

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Get Agentverse Mailbox Keys

1. Go to [https://agentverse.ai](https://agentverse.ai)
2. Sign in / Create account
3. Navigate to "Agents" ‚Üí "Create Agent"
4. For each agent, get a mailbox API key:
   - Click "Local Agents"
   - Click "Connect Local Agent"
   - Copy the Mailbox API Key

You need **6 mailbox keys** (one for each agent):
- Portfolio Coordinator
- Chain Scanner
- MeTTa Knowledge
- Strategy Engine
- Execution Agent
- Performance Tracker

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file:

```bash
# Agentverse Mailbox Keys
COORDINATOR_MAILBOX_KEY="your-coordinator-mailbox-key-here"
SCANNER_MAILBOX_KEY="your-scanner-mailbox-key-here"
METTA_MAILBOX_KEY="your-metta-mailbox-key-here"
STRATEGY_MAILBOX_KEY="your-strategy-mailbox-key-here"
EXECUTION_MAILBOX_KEY="your-execution-mailbox-key-here"
TRACKER_MAILBOX_KEY="your-tracker-mailbox-key-here"

# Agent Seeds (use unique phrases for production)
COORDINATOR_SEED="my-unique-coordinator-seed-phrase"
SCANNER_SEED="my-unique-scanner-seed-phrase"
METTA_SEED="my-unique-metta-seed-phrase"
STRATEGY_SEED="my-unique-strategy-seed-phrase"
EXECUTION_SEED="my-unique-execution-seed-phrase"
TRACKER_SEED="my-unique-tracker-seed-phrase"

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT="production"  # Change to production for deployment
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Use the same seed phrase across sessions to maintain the same agent address!

### Step 3: Deploy Agents

Open 6 terminal windows and run each agent:

#### Terminal 1: Portfolio Coordinator
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/portfolio_coordinator.py
```

Look for output:
```
Portfolio Coordinator Agent started
Agent address: agent1q2x3y4z5a6b7c8d9e0f1g2h3i4j5k6l7m8n9o0p1q2
ASI:One compatible: YES
Chat Protocol: ENABLED
Manifest published successfully: AgentChatProtocol
Registration on Almanac API successful
```

**Copy the agent address!** You'll need it for the README.

#### Terminal 2: Chain Scanner
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/chain_scanner.py
```

#### Terminal 3: MeTTa Knowledge
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/metta_knowledge.py
```

#### Terminal 4: Strategy Engine
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/strategy_engine.py
```

#### Terminal 5: Execution Agent
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/execution_agent.py
```

#### Terminal 6: Performance Tracker
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/performance_tracker.py
```

### Step 4: Verify Registration on Agentverse

1. Go to [Agentverse Dashboard](https://agentverse.ai)
2. Navigate to "Agents"
3. You should see all 6 agents listed:
   - yieldswarm-coordinator (with Chat Protocol badge)
   - yieldswarm-scanner
   - yieldswarm-metta
   - yieldswarm-strategy
   - yieldswarm-execution
   - yieldswarm-tracker

4. Check each agent's details:
   - ‚úÖ Agent address visible
   - ‚úÖ Status: Online
   - ‚úÖ Protocol manifest published (for coordinator)

### Step 5: Update README with Agent Addresses

Edit `README.md` and add the actual agent addresses:

```markdown
## ü§ñ Agent Addresses (Agentverse)

| Agent | Address | ASI:One Compatible | Port |
|-------|---------|-------------------|------|
| **Portfolio Coordinator** | `agent1q2x3y4z5...` | ‚úÖ YES | 8000 |
| **Chain Scanner** | `agent1qa1b2c3d4...` | - | 8001 |
| **MeTTa Knowledge** | `agent1qe5f6g7h8...` | - | 8002 |
| **Strategy Engine** | `agent1qi9j0k1l2...` | - | 8003 |
| **Execution Agent** | `agent1qm3n4o5p6...` | - | 8004 |
| **Performance Tracker** | `agent1qq7r8s9t0...` | - | 8005 |
```

## üß™ Testing via ASI:One

### Step 1: Access ASI:One Interface

1. Go to [ASI:One](https://asi1.ai) (or relevant ASI:One interface)
2. Sign in with your account

### Step 2: Find Your Agent

1. Search for "yieldswarm-coordinator"
2. Or search by agent address: `agent1q...`
3. Click on the agent to open chat

### Step 3: Test Natural Language Interaction

Try these test commands:

#### Test 1: Help Command
```
You: "help"

Expected Response:
ü§ñ YieldSwarm AI Commands:
Investment: 'Invest [amount] [currency] with [risk] risk'
Portfolio: 'Show my portfolio' or 'Check performance'
...
```

#### Test 2: Conservative Investment
```
You: "I want to invest 5 ETH conservatively on Ethereum"

Expected Response:
‚úÖ Investment Request Parsed:
Amount: 5.0 ETH
Risk Level: conservative
Chains: ethereum
...
```

#### Test 3: Aggressive Multi-Chain
```
You: "Maximize 10 ETH aggressively across Solana and BSC"

Expected Response:
‚úÖ Investment Request Parsed:
Amount: 10.0 ETH
Risk Level: aggressive
Chains: solana, bsc
...
```

#### Test 4: Portfolio Status
```
You: "Show my portfolio"

Expected Response:
üìä Portfolio Status:
...
```

### Step 4: Verify Agent Logs

Check terminal outputs to see agents responding:

- **Coordinator**: Should log "Received message from..."
- **Scanner**: Should continue scanning chains
- **Other agents**: Should show ready status
