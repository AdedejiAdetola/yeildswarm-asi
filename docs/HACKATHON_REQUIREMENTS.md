About Artificial Superintelligence Alliance
The Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance unites Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and CUDOS to build a decentralized, ethical, and accessible AI ecosystem. Together, we’re pioneering the future of artificial intelligence and Web3 innovation.

Challenge Statement
Build Autonomous AI Agents with the ASI Alliance

This is your opportunity to develop AI agents that don't just execute code—they perceive, reason, and act across decentralized systems. The ASI Alliance in partnership with Fetch.ai Innovation Lab, brings together world-class infrastructure from Fetch.ai and SingularityNET to support the next generation of modular, autonomous AI systems.

Use Fetch.ai's uAgents framework or your preferred agentic stack to build agents that can interpret natural language, make decisions, and trigger real-world actions. Deploy them to Agentverse, the ASI-wide registry and orchestration layer where agents connect, collaborate, and self-organize.

Enhance your agents with structured knowledge from SingularityNET's MeTTa Knowledge Graph. For agent discovery and human interaction, integrate the Chat Protocol to make your agents accessible through the ASI:One interface.

Whether you're building in healthcare, logistics, finance, education, or DeAI-native applications—this is your launchpad. Develop agents that talk to each other. That learn and adapt. That drive real outcomes across sectors.

The future of decentralized AI isn't siloed. It's composable, cross-chain, and powered by the ASI Alliance.

Submission Requirements
Code

Share the link to your public GitHub repository to allow judges to access and test your project.

Ensure your README.md file includes key details about your agents, such as their name and address, for easy reference.

Mention any extra resources required to run your project and provide links to those resources.

All agents must be categorized under Innovation Lab.

To achieve this, include the following badge in your agent’s README.md file:


![tag:innovationlab](https://img.shields.io/badge/innovationlab-3D8BD3)
![tag:hackathon](https://img.shields.io/badge/hackathon-5F43F1)
