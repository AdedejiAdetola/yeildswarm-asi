### **[0:00 - 0:20] SCENE 1: The Hook - DeFi is Broken**

**üé• VISUAL:**
- Open with a split screen or quick montage:
  - Left: Trader with 10+ browser tabs (DeFi dashboards, price charts)
  - Right: Money/coins flying away (representing lost opportunity)
  - Overlay text stats appearing:
    - "100+ DeFi Protocols"
    - "20+ Blockchains"
    - "15-30% Returns Lost"
    - "$20B Market"

**üé§ NARRATION SCRIPT:**

> "DeFi investors face an impossible challenge: monitoring 100 protocols across 20 blockchains, manually chasing yields that change by the hour. The result? They're losing 15 to 30 percent of potential returns every year.
>
> Cross-chain arbitrage opportunities appear and disappear in just 9 seconds - humans simply can't compete. This is a $20 billion market problem that needs autonomous AI to solve."

**‚è±Ô∏è TIMING NOTES:**
- 0:00-0:08: Problem setup (8s)
- 0:08-0:15: Statistics (7s)
- 0:15-0:20: Market size + transition (5s)

**üìù SCREEN RECORDING DIRECTIONS:**
- Show quick screenshots of: Aave, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Curve dashboards
- Fade to black with text: "You need to be superhuman... or use YieldSwarm AI"

### **[0:20 - 0:50] SCENE 2: Meet YieldSwarm AI**

**üé• VISUAL:**
- Title card: "YieldSwarm AI" logo/text with tagline
- Animated hexagonal bee swarm pattern showing 4 solid agents + 2 outlined/dimmed agents
- Each agent icon appears with label:
  1. Portfolio Coordinator üéØ ‚úÖ
  2. Chain Scanner üîç ‚úÖ
  3. MeTTa Knowledge üß† ‚úÖ
  4. Strategy Engine ‚öôÔ∏è ‚úÖ
  5. Execution Agent ü§ù üöß (Coming Soon)
  6. Performance Tracker üìä üöß (Coming Soon)
- Bottom: ASI Alliance logos (Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, uAgents, MeTTa)

**üé§ NARRATION SCRIPT:**

> "Introducing YieldSwarm AI - an autonomous multi-agent system that optimizes DeFi yields 24/7 across multiple blockchains.
>
> Four live AI agents work together right now:
> - The Portfolio Coordinator understands natural language
> - Chain Scanner monitors 5 blockchains and 20+ protocols in real-time
> - MeTTa Knowledge Agent provides symbolic AI reasoning with a 22-protocol knowledge base
> - Strategy Engine calculates optimal risk-adjusted allocations
>
> Two additional agents are in development: the Execution Agent for safe transaction execution, and the Performance Tracker for analytics and continuous learning.
>
> All built entirely on the ASI Alliance stack: uAgents framework, MeTTa knowledge graphs, Agentverse deployment, and ASI:One Chat Protocol."

**‚è±Ô∏è TIMING NOTES:**
- 0:20-0:28: Intro and solution statement (8s)
- 0:28-0:42: Four live agents overview (14s)
- 0:42-0:50: Future agents + ASI Alliance tech stack (8s)

**üìù SCREEN RECORDING DIRECTIONS:**
- Use simple animations or slide transitions
- Emphasize "Built on ASI Alliance" with logo zoom
- Keep agent icons visible as you narrate each one

---

### **[0:50 - 1:50] SCENE 3: Live Demo on ASI:One** ‚≠ê **MOST IMPORTANT**

**üé• VISUAL:**
- Full screen recording of ASI:One chat interface
- Show typing in real-time (or sped up 1.5x)
- Agent responses appearing
- Optional: Picture-in-picture showing your narration OR just voiceover

**üé§ NARRATION SCRIPT:**

> "Let's see it in action. I'm opening the ASI:One interface and searching for the YieldSwarm Portfolio Coordinator.
>
> [Typing on screen] I'll type: 'I want to invest 10 ETH with moderate risk across Ethereum and Polygon.'
>
> Watch what happens: The Portfolio Coordinator receives my request and immediately coordinates with the other agents.
>
> [Pause for agent response to appear - about 5-8 seconds]
>
> The Chain Scanner is fetching live APY data from multiple protocols:
> - Aave on Ethereum: 4.5% APY
> - Curve stETH: 5.2%
> - Aave on Polygon: 6.8%
>
> The MeTTa Knowledge Agent is reasoning through its 22-protocol knowledge base, identifying which protocols match 'moderate risk' - those are protocols with risk scores below 4.0, fully audited, with proven track records.
>
> The Strategy Engine calculates the optimal allocation:
> - 40% to Aave Ethereum - stable lending
> - 30% to Curve stETH - low impermanent loss risk
> - 30% cross-chain to Aave Polygon - capturing 2.3% higher yield
>
> [Agent response fully visible now]
>
> Notice the transparency: The system explains its reasoning. Expected APY is 5.8%, risk score is 3.2 out of 10 - firmly in moderate territory. It even estimates gas costs at $45 total.
>
> This is explainable AI in action - you understand exactly why these recommendations are made. No black box, full transparency."

**‚è±Ô∏è TIMING NOTES:**
- 0:50-0:58: ASI:One interface introduction (8s)
- 0:58-1:05: Type query and send (7s)
- 1:05-1:12: Agent coordination explanation (7s)
- 1:12-1:24: Chain Scanner data (12s)
- 1:24-1:35: MeTTa reasoning (11s)
- 1:35-1:45: Strategy results explanation (10s)
- 1:45-1:50: Transparency and explainability (5s)

**üìù SCREEN RECORDING DIRECTIONS:**

**CRITICAL - Actual Steps to Record:**

1. **Open ASI:One** (https://asi1.ai or appropriate URL)
2. **Search for agent**: "YieldSwarm Portfolio Coordinator" or use address:
   ```
   agent1qwumkwejd0rxnxxu64yrl7vj3f29ydvvq85yntvrvjyzpce86unwxhfdz5a
   ```
3. **Open chat interface** with the agent
4. **Type the test query** (you can speed this up in editing):
   ```
   I want to invest 10 ETH with moderate risk across Ethereum and Polygon
   ```
5. **Wait for response** (should take 5-15 seconds depending on agent load)
6. **Show the complete response** - scroll through if long
7. **Highlight key sections** using mouse cursor or zoom:
   - The allocation percentages
   - The reasoning section
   - The risk score
   - Expected APY

**Backup Plan:**
- If live demo fails, use pre-recorded footage
- Alternative test queries:
  - "Invest 5 ETH conservatively on Ethereum only"
  - "What's the best high-yield strategy for 20 ETH?"
  - "Show me moderate risk options across all chains"

**Visual Enhancement Tips:**
- Zoom in on important text (80-100% zoom is ideal)
- Use cursor to point at key information as you narrate
- Keep mouse movements smooth and purposeful
- If editing: Add subtle highlight boxes around key info

  ```
- Split screen or transition to:
  - MeTTa knowledge graph visualization (code or diagram)
  - uAgents logo
  - Agentverse dashboard screenshot showing 4 live agents

**üé§ NARRATION SCRIPT:**

> "Here's what makes YieldSwarm AI revolutionary:
>
> First, this is the world's first DeFi optimizer powered by MeTTa symbolic AI knowledge graphs. Unlike black-box machine learning, MeTTa provides explainable reasoning - understanding protocol relationships, historical patterns, and risk models.
>
> Second, true multi-agent coordination: Four live agents communicate via the Fetch.ai uAgents framework, all registered on Agentverse for decentralized discovery and orchestration. Two more agents are in development to complete the ecosystem.
>
> Third, the ASI:One Chat Protocol makes advanced DeFi accessible through natural language. No need to understand smart contracts, gas optimization, or bridge protocols - just tell the system what you want.
>
> This perfectly demonstrates the ASI Alliance vision: autonomous agents that perceive, reason, and act across decentralized systems."

**‚è±Ô∏è TIMING NOTES:**
- 1:50-1:58: MeTTa innovation (8s)
- 1:58-2:06: Multi-agent coordination (4 live + 2 future) (8s)
- 2:06-2:14: Natural language accessibility (8s)
- 2:14-2:20: ASI Alliance alignment (6s)

**üìù SCREEN RECORDING DIRECTIONS:**
