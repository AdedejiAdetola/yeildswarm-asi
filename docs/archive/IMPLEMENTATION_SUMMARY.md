# YieldSwarm AI - Implementation Summary
## Full Agent Workflow Implementation

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Session:** Continuation from previous work
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - Ready for Testing**

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Portfolio Coordinator Update ✅
**File:** `agents/portfolio_coordinator_http.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added imports for inter-agent message protocols (`OpportunityRequest`, `MeTTaQueryRequest`, `StrategyRequest`, etc.)
2. Created async functions to communicate with agents:
   - `query_scanner_agent()` - Queries Chain Scanner for opportunities
   - `query_metta_agent()` - Queries MeTTa Knowledge for protocol insights
   - `query_strategy_agent()` - Queries Strategy Engine for optimal allocation
3. Updated `process_user_message()` to orchestrate full agent workflow:
   - Step 1: Query Scanner for opportunities
   - Step 2: Query MeTTa for knowledge insights
   - Step 3: Send both to Strategy Engine
   - Step 4: Aggregate and format final response
4. Added intelligent fallback when agents are offline

**Result:** Coordinator now acts as a true orchestrator, coordinating 3 specialized agents!

---

### Phase 2: Chain Scanner HTTP Endpoints ✅
**File:** `agents/chain_scanner.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added FastAPI imports and setup
2. Created HTTP API alongside uAgents protocol:
   - `GET /` - Health check endpoint
   - `POST /query_opportunities` - Main endpoint for opportunity scanning
3. Added dual-mode startup:
   - HTTP server runs on port 8001 (background thread)
   - uAgents protocol runs simultaneously
4. Reused existing scan logic for HTTP endpoints

**Result:** Scanner can now be called via HTTP by Coordinator AND via uAgents messaging!

---

### Phase 3: MeTTa Knowledge HTTP Endpoints ✅
**File:** `agents/metta_knowledge.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added FastAPI imports and setup
2. Created HTTP API:
   - `GET /` - Health check endpoint
   - `POST /query_knowledge` - Knowledge query endpoint
3. Supports all query types:
   - `find_protocols` - Find best protocols for risk/chains
   - `optimize_allocation` - Get allocation strategy
   - `assess_risk` - Assess protocol risk
4. Added dual-mode startup (HTTP + uAgents)

**Result:** MeTTa agent accessible via HTTP and uAgents!

---

### Phase 4: Strategy Engine HTTP Endpoints ✅
**File:** `agents/strategy_engine.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added FastAPI imports and protocols
2. Created HTTP API:
   - `GET /` - Health check endpoint
   - `POST /generate_strategy` - Strategy generation endpoint
3. Added model conversion:
   - Protocol messages → Internal models
   - Internal strategy → Protocol response
4. Returns detailed allocation breakdown with reasoning

**Result:** Strategy Engine can generate strategies via HTTP!

## 📋 How to Test the Full Workflow

### Step 1: Restart All Agents (REQUIRED)

The agents need to be restarted to enable the new HTTP endpoints.

**Current running agents will NOT have the HTTP endpoints yet!**

```bash
# Stop all running agents first
pkill -f "portfolio_coordinator_http"
pkill -f "chain_scanner"
pkill -f "metta_knowledge"
pkill -f "strategy_engine"

# Wait a moment for cleanup
sleep 2

# Start agents in separate terminals:

# Terminal 1: Portfolio Coordinator
cd /home/grey/web3/asi_agents
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/portfolio_coordinator_http.py

# Terminal 2: Chain Scanner
cd /home/grey/web3/asi_agents
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/chain_scanner.py

# Terminal 3: MeTTa Knowledge
cd /home/grey/web3/asi_agents
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/metta_knowledge.py

# Terminal 4: Strategy Engine
cd /home/grey/web3/asi_agents
source venv/bin/activate
python agents/strategy_engine.py

# Terminal 5: Backend (if not already running)
cd /home/grey/web3/asi_agents
source venv/bin/activate
python run_backend_v2.py

# Terminal 6: Frontend (if not already running)
cd /home/grey/web3/asi_agents/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Verify All Services

```bash
# Check all services are running
ss -tuln | grep -E ':(3000|8000|8001|8002|8003|8080) '

# Should see:
# ✅ Port 3000 - Frontend
# ✅ Port 8000 - Coordinator
# ✅ Port 8001 - Scanner
# ✅ Port 8002 - MeTTa
# ✅ Port 8003 - Strategy
# ✅ Port 8080 - Backend
```

### Step 3: Test End-to-End

**Test via Frontend:**
```
Open: http://localhost:3000
Type: "Invest 15 ETH with moderate risk on Ethereum and Polygon"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
✅ Strategy Generated by Agent Swarm!

📊 Investment Plan:
Amount: 15.0 ETH
Risk Level: Moderate
Chains: Ethereum, Polygon

🎯 Optimal Allocation:
• Aave-V3 (Ethereum): 4.50 ETH (30.0%) @ 4.5% APY
• Uniswap-V3 (Ethereum): 4.50 ETH (30.0%) @ 12.3% APY
• Aave-V3 (Polygon): 3.00 ETH (20.0%) @ 5.2% APY
• QuickSwap (Polygon): 3.00 ETH (20.0%) @ 10.5% APY

📈 Expected Portfolio APY: 8.35%
⚖️  Portfolio Risk Score: 3.2/10

🧠 MeTTa Reasoning:
Found 4 protocols matching moderate risk on chains: ethereum, polygon

⚙️  Strategy Reasoning:
Optimized allocation using 4 protocols. Estimated gas: 0.0320 ETH. Strategy favors balance.

✨ 8 opportunities scanned across 2 chains!
```

**Test via cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Invest 10 ETH aggressive","user_id":"test"}'
```

## 🎨 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Real Agent Coordination
- Portfolio Coordinator orchestrates 3 specialized agents
- Each agent processes requests and returns structured data
- Results are aggregated and formatted for users

### 2. Dual-Mode Agents
- All agents support both uAgents protocol AND HTTP REST
- HTTP for Coordinator integration
- uAgents for future agent-to-agent messaging and Agentverse deployment

### 3. Intelligent Fallback
- If agents are offline, Coordinator provides helpful error message
- Tells user which agents to start
- System degrades gracefully

### 4. Structured Message Protocol
- Using Pydantic models from `protocols/messages.py`
- Type-safe communication between agents
- Clear request/response patterns

### 5. Dynamic Responses
- Scanner finds real opportunities (mock data for now)
- MeTTa provides knowledge-based insights
- Strategy optimizes based on risk tolerance
- Final response shows actual allocations, APY, risk scores

---

## 🔧 What's Different from Before

### Before:
```python
# Coordinator returned hardcoded response
response = (
    f"✅ Investment Request Received!\n\n"
    f"🔄 Coordinating my agent swarm:\n"
    f"• 📡 Chain Scanner - Scanning...\n"
    f"💡 My 6 specialized agents work together!"
)
```

### After:
```python
# Coordinator actually queries agents
scanner_response = await query_scanner_agent(...)
metta_response = await query_metta_agent(...)
strategy_response = await query_strategy_agent(...)

# Real allocation breakdown
allocation_text = "\n".join([
    f"• {alloc.protocol} ({alloc.chain}): "
    f"{alloc.amount:.2f} ETH ({alloc.percentage:.1f}%) "
    f"@ {alloc.expected_apy:.1f}% APY"
    for alloc in strategy_response.allocations
])
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If agents don't communicate:
1. Check all agents are restarted (not the old processes)
2. Verify ports 8001, 8002, 8003 are listening
3. Check logs for HTTP errors
4. Try manual curl tests to each endpoint

### If response is still generic:
1. Agent communication failed - check logs
2. Agents are running old code - restart them
3. Firewall blocking localhost ports

### If you see "agents may be offline":
1. This is the fallback - agents aren't responding
2. Check which agents are actually running
3. Restart the specific agent that's not responding
