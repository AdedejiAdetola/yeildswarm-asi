## Response Structure

Every valid investment request should return:

### 1. Portfolio Allocation
```markdown
## üìä Recommended Allocation

### 1. Uniswap-V3 (ethereum)
- Amount: **3.50 ETH** (35.0%)
- Expected APY: **12.21%**
- Risk Score: 3.5/10

### 2. QuickSwap (polygon)
- Amount: **3.00 ETH** (30.0%)
- Expected APY: **9.75%**
- Risk Score: 4.0/10

[... more allocations ...]
```

### 2. Portfolio Metrics
```markdown
## üìà Portfolio Metrics
- **Expected APY:** 9.18%
- **Portfolio Risk:** 3.2/10
- **Estimated Gas:** 0.0451 ETH
```

### 3. MeTTa AI Analysis
```markdown
## üß† MeTTa AI Analysis
Symbolic Reasoning (MeTTa Knowledge Base):
- Strategy: Balanced risk-reward optimization...
- Chain Diversification: 2 blockchain(s)...
- Knowledge Base: 22 protocols analyzed across 5 chains
```

## System Flow Verification

### Agent Communication Chain
```
User Input (ASI:One)
    ‚Üì
1. Portfolio Coordinator (validates & parses)
    ‚Üì
2. Chain Scanner (finds opportunities)
    ‚Üì
3. MeTTa Knowledge (symbolic reasoning)
    ‚Üì
4. Strategy Engine (creates allocation)
    ‚Üì
5. Coordinator (sends response to user)
```

### Expected Timing
- Input validation: < 100ms
- Full response: 5-10 seconds (agent-to-agent communication)
- Invalid input response: < 1 second

---

## Edge Cases

### 1. Very Small Amount
```
Input: "Invest 0.1 ETH with moderate risk"

Expected: Should work but warn about gas costs
```

### 2. Very Large Amount
```
Input: "Invest 1000 ETH with moderate risk"

Expected: Should work with diversification across more protocols
```

### 3. Unsupported Chain
```
Input: "Invest 10 ETH on Avalanche"

Expected: Defaults to Ethereum/Polygon (supported chains)
```

### 4. Mixed Keywords
```
Input: "I want to invest 10 eth but be safe about it"

Expected: Parses as 10 ETH conservative risk
```

## Verification Checklist

When testing, verify:

- [ ] Input validation catches greetings correctly
- [ ] Input validation catches gibberish correctly
- [ ] Help request provides full guide
- [ ] Valid requests proceed to agents
- [ ] Response includes all 4 sections (allocation, metrics, MeTTa, strategy)
- [ ] Risk levels produce different protocols
  - Conservative: Low-risk protocols (Aave, Curve, Lido)
  - Moderate: Balanced mix
  - Aggressive: High-yield protocols (Raydium, GMX)
- [ ] Chain filtering works correctly
- [ ] MeTTa reasoning mentions knowledge base
- [ ] Portfolio metrics are calculated correctly
- [ ] Response time is reasonable (< 15 seconds)

## Known Protocol Distribution

Based on the MeTTa Knowledge Base (22 protocols):

### By Risk Level
- **Low Risk (< 3.0):** MakerDAO, Curve, Lido, Aave-V3, Rocket-Pool, Compound-V3, Frax
- **Medium Risk (3.0-5.0):** Convex, Yearn, Uniswap-V3, Balancer, QuickSwap, Beefy, Stargate, Venus, PancakeSwap
- **High Risk (> 5.0):** Raydium, Solend, GMX, Trader-Joe, Synapse

### By Chain
- **Ethereum:** 13 protocols
- **Polygon:** 11 protocols
- **Arbitrum:** 9 protocols
- **BSC:** 5 protocols
- **Solana:** 3 protocols

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No response
**Solution:** Check agent is running on Agentverse, verify address

### Issue: Wrong protocols recommended
**Solution:** Verify risk level parsing, check MeTTa agent logs

### Issue: Same response for all inputs
**Solution:** Check input validation isn't blocking all requests

### Issue: Error messages
**Solution:** Check agent-to-agent communication, verify all agents deployed

---

## Testing on Local vs Agentverse

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start all agents
./start_all_agents.sh

# Send test request to coordinator
python test_agent_flow.py
```

### Agentverse Testing
- Use ASI:One chat interface
- Send messages directly to coordinator address
- Monitor agent interaction counts on dashboard

---

## Performance Benchmarks

**Expected Performance:**
- Input validation: < 100ms
- Scanner response: 1-2 seconds
- MeTTa analysis: 1-2 seconds
- Strategy generation: 1-2 seconds
