# Agent Inspector - "Could not find this Agent on your local host" - EXPLAINED

## The Problem

When you open the Agent Inspector URL:
```
https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8001&address=agent1qw9...
```

You get: **"Could not find this Agent on your local host"**

## Why This Happens

### The Root Cause
The **Agentverse Agent Inspector** is a **cloud-based service** running on `agentverse.ai`.

When you configure your agent with:
```python
endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"]
```

- `127.0.0.1` means "**THIS** computer" (localhost)
- To your machine: `127.0.0.1:8001` = your local agent ✅
- To Agentverse cloud: `127.0.0.1:8001` = Agentverse's own machine ❌

**The Inspector tries to connect to `127.0.0.1` from the cloud, but your agent is on YOUR machine!**

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Local Monitoring (Recommended for Development)

Your agents ARE working! You just can't use the cloud Inspector. Monitor them locally:

#### A. Check Logs Directly
Your agent prints everything to console:
```bash
python agents/chain_scanner.py
```

You'll see:
- ✅ Agent address
- ✅ Port info
- ✅ All scan results
- ✅ Message activity
- ✅ Errors and warnings

#### B. Use Local Testing Script
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python test_agent_locally.py
```

This checks which agents are running on their ports.

#### C. Monitor with curl
```bash
# Check agent status (won't return much, but proves it's running)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

### Option 2: Make Agent Network-Accessible (For Remote Inspector)

To use the cloud Inspector, your agent needs a **public or network-accessible IP**.

#### Steps:

1. **Get your network IP:**
```bash
hostname -I
```
Your IP: `172.19.23.109` (or similar)

2. **Update agents to use network IP:**

Edit each agent file, change:
```python
# OLD (localhost only)
endpoint=["http://127.0.0.1:8001/submit"]

# NEW (network accessible)
endpoint=["http://172.19.23.109:8001/submit"]
```

3. **Ensure firewall allows connections:**
```bash
# Check if port is accessible
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 8001/tcp  # if firewall is blocking
```

4. **Update Inspector URL:**
```
https://agentverse.ai/inspect/?uri=http%3A//172.19.23.109%3A8001&address=agent1qw9dz27z0ydhm7g5d2k022wg3q32zjcr009p833ag94w9udgqfx9u746ck9
```

⚠️ **Security Warning:** This exposes your agent to your network. Only do this in trusted networks.

### Option 3: Use ngrok for Public Access (Testing Only)

Make your local agent temporarily public:

```bash
# Install ngrok
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz
tar -xvzf ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz

# Start tunnel
./ngrok http 8001
```

This gives you a public URL like `https://abc123.ngrok.io` that you can use with Agent Inspector.

## Current Agent Status

Your **Chain Scanner IS running** correctly:
```bash
ps aux | grep chain_scanner
# grey  9853  1.2  1.0 685320 81252 pts/3    Sl+  00:39   0:03 python agents/chain_scanner.py
```

It's:
- ✅ Scanning chains every 30 seconds
- ✅ Finding opportunities
- ✅ Logging everything to console
- ✅ Listening on port 8001
- ⚠️ Just not accessible to cloud Inspector (by design!)

---

## Recommended Approach for Development

### For Local Testing (Now):
1. Run agents in terminal windows
2. Watch console output for logs
3. Use `test_agent_locally.py` to verify they're running
4. Test agent communication with `test_local_interaction.py`

### For Production (Later):
1. Deploy to a server with public IP
2. Use network IP in endpoint configuration
3. Then Agent Inspector will work from anywhere
4. Or deploy to Agentverse with `mailbox=True` (no Inspector needed)

## Understanding Agent Modes

| Mode | Endpoint | Inspector Access | Use Case |
|------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **Local Dev** | `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/submit` | ❌ Cloud Inspector won't work | Development on your machine |
| **Network** | `http://YOUR_IP:PORT/submit` | ✅ Works on same network | Testing with others |
| **Public** | `http://PUBLIC_IP:PORT/submit` | ✅ Works anywhere | Production/Remote testing |
| **Mailbox** | `mailbox=True` (no endpoint) | ✅ Built-in Agentverse monitoring | Cloud deployment |

---

## Quick Fix Summary

**The "error" is not really an error!** Your setup is correct for local development.

**To verify your agent works:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run agent
python agents/chain_scanner.py

# You'll see live output showing it's working!
```

**To use Agent Inspector:**
- Either: Accept you can't use it with localhost (recommended for dev)
- Or: Update endpoints to use network IP `172.19.23.109`
- Or: Use ngrok for temporary public access

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Your agents are configured correctly for local development
2. ✅ They ARE working (check the terminal output!)
3. ✅ They CAN communicate with each other locally
4. ❌ Cloud Inspector won't work with `127.0.0.1` (by design)

**Choose your path:**
- **Keep developing locally**: Monitor via console logs ✅
- **Want Inspector**: Update to network IP or ngrok ⚙️
- **Want cloud deployment**: Switch to mailbox mode ☁️

Your agents are working perfectly! The Inspector limitation is just a networking reality, not a bug.
