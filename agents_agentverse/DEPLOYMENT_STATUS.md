# YieldSwarm ASI Agentverse Deployment Status

## Latest Updates (2025-10-15)

### ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

#### 1. **State Persistence Fix** (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** The coordinator was losing track of pending requests, causing "Unknown request ID" errors.

**Root Cause:** The `pending_requests = {}` dictionary was not persisting between handler calls in Agentverse's execution environment.

**Solution:** Migrated to `ctx.storage` API for persistent state management across handler calls:
```python
# OLD (❌ Lost state between handlers)
pending_requests[request_id] = {...}

# NEW (✅ Persistent storage)
await ctx.storage.set(f"req_{request_id}", {...})
req_ctx = await ctx.storage.get(f"req_{request_id}")
await ctx.storage.remove(f"req_{request_id}")
```

**Files Modified:**
- `0_COORDINATOR.py` - All request state management now uses `ctx.storage`

#### 2. **Chat Protocol Configuration** (ALL AGENTS)
**What:** Added ASI:One Chat Protocol support to all 6 agents for discoverability and compatibility.

**Changes Made:**
- Added `from uagents_core.contrib.protocols.chat import chat_protocol_spec`
- Added `chat_protocol = Protocol(spec=chat_protocol_spec)`
- Added `agent.include(chat_protocol, publish_manifest=True)`
- Added `ASI_ONE_API_KEY` configuration

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `0_COORDINATOR.py` - Chat Protocol + ASI:One LLM integration
- ✅ `1_chain_scanner.py` - Chat Protocol support
- ✅ `2_metta_knowledge.py` - Chat Protocol support
- ✅ `3_strategy_engine.py` - Chat Protocol support
- ✅ `4_execution_agent.py` - Chat Protocol support
- ✅ `5_performance_tracker.py` - Chat Protocol support

#### 3. **Localhost Endpoint Removal** (ALL AGENTS)
**What:** Removed `endpoint=["http://localhost:..."]` from all agents, as Agentverse auto-configures endpoints.

**Why:** Localhost endpoints prevented agents from communicating with each other in Agentverse's hosted environment.

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Re-deploy Coordinator ⏳
- [ ] Copy `0_COORDINATOR.py` to Agentverse
- [ ] Verify no syntax errors
- [ ] Check logs for "✅ Ready for ASI:One requests"
- [ ] Note: This agent has the state persistence fix

### Step 2: Re-deploy Other Agents ⏳
- [ ] `1_chain_scanner.py` - Re-deploy
- [ ] `2_metta_knowledge.py` - Re-deploy
- [ ] `3_strategy_engine.py` - Re-deploy
- [ ] `4_execution_agent.py` - Re-deploy (optional for MVP)
- [ ] `5_performance_tracker.py` - Re-deploy (optional for MVP)

### Step 3: Verify Agent Addresses ⏳
Confirm these addresses in `0_COORDINATOR.py` match your deployed agents:
```python
SCANNER_ADDRESS = "agent1qtn2hgpdfl0he2h88xncvrdvyk5vd9xtsruw9vzua8tgnejtxxpzy8suu8r"
METTA_ADDRESS = "agent1qflfh899d98vw3337neylwjkfvc4exx6frsj6vqnaeq0ujwjf6ggcczc5y0"
STRATEGY_ADDRESS = "agent1qwqr4489ww7kplx456w5tpj4548s743wvp7ly3qjd6aurgp04cf4zswgyal"
```

### Step 4: Test End-to-End Flow ⏳
**Test Message:**
```
Invest 10 ETH with moderate risk
```

**Expected Log Sequence:**

**Coordinator Logs:**
```
📩 Received message from agent1q...
💬 User message: Invest 10 ETH with moderate risk
📝 Stored request ID: [uuid] in agent storage
📡 Requesting opportunities from Scanner...
✅ Received 3 opportunities from Scanner
🧠 Sending to MeTTa for analysis...
✅ MeTTa request sent successfully
```

**Scanner Logs:**
```
📩 Received scan request [uuid]
✓ Scanned Ethereum: 3 opportunities
✅ Found 3 opportunities matching criteria
📤 Sent 3 opportunities to coordinator
```

**MeTTa Logs:**
```
============================================================
🔥 METTA RECEIVED A MESSAGE!
============================================================
📨 Received MeTTa Query: [uuid]
✅ Sent MeTTa response: [uuid]
```

**Strategy Logs:**
```
📨 Received Strategy Request: [uuid]
✅ Generated strategy: 3 allocations
```

**Expected User Response:**
```
[Natural language response generated by ASI:One LLM]

## 🎯 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **State Management** | Module-level dict `pending_requests = {}` | Persistent `ctx.storage` API |
| **Localhost Endpoints** | ❌ Present (blocking communication) | ✅ Removed (Agentverse auto-config) |
| **Chat Protocol** | ✅ Coordinator only | ✅ All agents (for discoverability) |
| **Debug Logging** | Minimal | Enhanced with storage checks |
| **Storage Cleanup** | `del pending_requests[id]` | `await ctx.storage.remove(f"req_{id}")` |

---

## 🐛 DEBUGGING TIPS

### If "Unknown request ID" still occurs:
1. Check coordinator logs for "📝 Stored request ID: [uuid] in agent storage"
2. Verify the same UUID appears in Scanner logs
3. Check if `ctx.storage.get()` is returning `None`
4. This would indicate a storage persistence issue in Agentverse

### If agents can't communicate:
1. Verify all agents show "Successfully started agent" in logs
2. Check agent addresses match in coordinator config
3. Ensure `mailbox=True` is set for all agents
4. Verify no `endpoint=` parameter is present

### If ASI:One LLM fails:
1. Check if `ASI_ONE_API_KEY` is correct
2. Response will fall back to template format
3. Look for error logs in coordinator

## 📊 INTERACTION COUNT EXPECTATIONS

After a successful test message:

| Agent | Expected Interactions | Why |
|-------|----------------------|-----|
| Coordinator | 8+ | User message (2) + Scanner response + MeTTa response + Strategy response + User response |
| Scanner | 2+ | Request from coordinator + Response to coordinator |
| MeTTa | 2+ | Request from coordinator + Response to coordinator |
| Strategy | 2+ | Request from coordinator + Response to coordinator |
| Execution | 0 | Not used in basic flow |
| Tracker | 0 | Not used in basic flow |

**Previous Issue:** MeTTa and Strategy had 0 interactions because:
1. Coordinator was losing state (fixed via `ctx.storage`)
2. Localhost endpoints blocked communication (fixed by removal)

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS AFTER SUCCESSFUL TEST

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any timeout or delay issues
2. **Test Multiple Requests**: Send 3-5 requests in sequence to verify storage cleanup
3. **Test Different Risk Levels**: Try "conservative", "moderate", "aggressive"
4. **Test Different Chains**: Try "Invest on Polygon", "Invest on Solana"
5. **Publish to ASI:One Marketplace**: Make coordinator discoverable
6. **Documentation**: Update README with deployment guide
7. **Demo Video**: Create 3-5 minute walkthrough

---

## 📝 NOTES

- **Chat Protocol on all agents**: While only the Coordinator needs Chat Protocol for user interaction, adding it to all agents improves discoverability and future-proofs for potential direct interaction scenarios.

- **ASI:One API Key**: Currently hardcoded. For production, use environment variables in Agentverse.

- **Storage Persistence**: `ctx.storage` in Agentverse persists across handler calls but may be cleared on agent restart. For long-term storage, consider external database.
