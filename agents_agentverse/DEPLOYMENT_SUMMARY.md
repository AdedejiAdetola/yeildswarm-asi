## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Chain Scanner ✅ DONE

You've already deployed this one successfully!

**Address:** `agent1qtn2hgpdfl0he2h88xncvrdvyk5vd9xtsruw9vzua8tgnejtxxpzy8suu8r`

---

### Step 2: Deploy MeTTa Knowledge

1. Go to https://agentverse.ai
2. Click **"Create New Agent"**
3. Delete all code in the editor
4. Open `agents_agentverse/2_metta_knowledge.py`
5. Copy ALL the code
6. Paste into Agentverse editor
7. Click **"Save/Deploy"**
8. Wait for logs: **"Successfully started agent"**
9. **Copy the agent address** from logs
10. Save it: `METTA_ADDRESS = "agent1q..."`

---

### Step 3: Deploy Strategy Engine

1. Create another new agent in Agentverse
2. Delete all code
3. Open `agents_agentverse/3_strategy_engine.py`
4. Copy ALL the code
5. Paste into Agentverse
6. Deploy
7. **Copy the agent address**
8. Save it: `STRATEGY_ADDRESS = "agent1q..."`

---

### Step 4: Update and Deploy Coordinator

**IMPORTANT:** Do this LAST, after deploying other agents!

1. Open `agents_agentverse/0_COORDINATOR.py` in a text editor
2. Find lines 120-124:

```python
# TODO: REPLACE THESE WITH YOUR ACTUAL DEPLOYED AGENT ADDRESSES!
SCANNER_ADDRESS = "agent1qtn2hgpdfl0he2h88xncvrdvyk5vd9xtsruw9vzua8tgnejtxxpzy8suu8r"
METTA_ADDRESS = "agent1q0nwxnu6dhws86gxqd7sv5ywv57nnsncfhxcgnxkxkh5mshgze9kuvztx0t"
STRATEGY_ADDRESS = "agent1q0v38te45h3ns2nas9pluajdzguww6t99t37x9lp7an5e3pcckpxkgreypz"
```

3. **Replace** with your actual addresses from Steps 1-3:

```python
SCANNER_ADDRESS = "agent1qtn2hgpdfl0he2h88xncvrdvyk5vd9xtsruw9vzua8tgnejtxxpzy8suu8r"  # Your Chain Scanner
METTA_ADDRESS = "agent1q..."  # Your MeTTa Knowledge address
STRATEGY_ADDRESS = "agent1q..."  # Your Strategy Engine address
```

4. Save the file
5. Create new agent in Agentverse
6. Copy the UPDATED coordinator code
7. Paste and deploy
8. **Copy the coordinator address**

---

## 🧪 Testing

After all agents are deployed:

### Test 1: Check Agent Status

1. Go to https://agentverse.ai/agents
2. Verify all 4 agents show "Running" status
3. Check logs for each agent - should show startup messages

### Test 2: Send Test Message via ASI:One

1. Go to your coordinator agent page
2. Click **"Chat"** button
3. Send: **"Invest 10 ETH with moderate risk"**
4. Expected response (within 10-30 seconds):
   - Portfolio strategy with 3-4 protocols
   - APY percentages
   - Risk scores
   - MeTTa reasoning
   - Strategy explanation

### Test 3: Verify Agent Communication

Check coordinator logs for this sequence:
```
📩 Received message from [user]
📡 Requesting opportunities from Scanner...
✅ Received X opportunities from Scanner
🧠 Sending to MeTTa for analysis...
✅ MeTTa recommends: [protocols]
⚡ Requesting strategy from Engine...
✅ Strategy generated: X allocations
📤 Sent strategy to user
```

## 📊 Agent Addresses Template

Save these for your README update:

```markdown
| Agent | Address | ASI:One Compatible | Port |
|-------|---------|-------------------|------|
| **Portfolio Coordinator** | `agent1q...` | ✅ YES | 8000 |
| **Chain Scanner** | `agent1qtn2hgpdfl0he2h88xncvrdvyk5vd9xtsruw9vzua8tgnejtxxpzy8suu8r` | - | 8001 |
| **MeTTa Knowledge** | `agent1q...` | - | 8002 |
| **Strategy Engine** | `agent1q...` | - | 8003 |
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Agent failed to start"
**Fix:** Check for Python syntax errors, ensure all imports are from standard libraries

### Issue: "AttributeError: 'Agent' object has no attribute 'name'"
**Fix:** Already fixed! Agents use `agent` instance instead of creating new Agent()

### Issue: Coordinator not responding
**Fix:** Verify you updated the agent addresses in coordinator code

### Issue: Messages not being received
**Fix:** Check that all agents have `mailbox=True` and are registered on Almanac

## ✅ Success Checklist

Before moving to Phase 5 (Testing), verify:

- [ ] Chain Scanner deployed and running
- [ ] MeTTa Knowledge deployed and running
- [ ] Strategy Engine deployed and running
- [ ] Coordinator updated with correct addresses
- [ ] Coordinator deployed and running
- [ ] All agents show "Successfully started" in logs
- [ ] All agents registered on Almanac
- [ ] Coordinator has Chat Protocol enabled

---

## 🎯 Next Phase

Once all checks pass:
- ✅ Phase 4: Deploy all agents to Agentverse - **IN PROGRESS**
- ⏳ Phase 5: Test via ASI:One dashboard
- ⏳ Phase 7: Record demo video
- ⏳ Phase 8: Final checks and submission

---

**Current Status:** Chain Scanner deployed ✅
**Next:** Deploy MeTTa Knowledge and Strategy Engine, then update and deploy Coordinator

Good luck! 🚀
